This is the repository for the Cause-of-Death manuscript:
There are three sub-projects, each one with more details in the local README.md file.
1) Original COD code, SEER draw redacted for privacy. Figures/tables in the paper come from this work. SEER draw specifications are provided so that input data can be regenerated if authorized.
2) Generation of synthetic COD data - produces COD data similar to the original SEER data to allow code running without the original SEER draw.
3) Synthetic COD code: replicates paper using synthetic data to demonstrate code/figure generation. Figures and tables from this directory are not used in the paper and are provided for informative purposes only.
