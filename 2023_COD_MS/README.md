This is the project for the 2023 SEER draw revision to the COD manuscript.  The data here has been updated slightly from the 2023 ASCO poster.

To run this codebase, the main coordination script scripts/00_coordination_script.R should be run. 
This can be accomplished by (for example) Rscript scripts/00_coordination_script.R run from this directory.

Multiple packages from CRAN are required, as seen in the code.

Note: because the SEER data has been redacted for privacy, this code will fail to run as the input data is missing. To examine the code in action,
look at the 2023_COD_Syn directory for code that runs from synthetic data.
