This uses synthetic data to run through the COD manuscript computation/figures. The difference is only in the input data source.

To run this codebase, the main coordination script scripts/00_coordination_script.R should be run. 
This can be accomplished by (for example) Rscript scripts/00_coordination_script.R run from this directory.

Output tiff and eps have been suppressed in the repository as they are redundant and less accessible than pdf.

Multiple packages from CRAN are required, as seen in the code.
